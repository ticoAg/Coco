# Legacy Python Backend (Archived)

This folder contains the original AgentMesh Python implementation (uv workspace + FastAPI orchestrator).

The project has since moved to a Rust-first architecture:

- macOS-only `.app` via Tauri
- Rust orchestrator + adapters as a CLI (`agentmesh`)
- React/Vite/Tailwind frontend focused on read-only visualization of the task directory

Kept here as reference while the Rust implementation is developed.
